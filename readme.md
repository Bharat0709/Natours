*STEP 1*
MAKE THE FILE SERVER.JS (THIS FILE IS THE STARTING POINT OF THE NODE APPLICATION)

*STEP 2*
MENTION PORT NUMBER THEN LISTEN TO THAT PORT USING APP.LISTEN()
REQUIRE APP.JS

*STEP 3* 
MAKE THE FILE APP.JS(THIS FILE HANDLES ALL THE MIDDLEWARES) 
AND INSTALL EXPRESS AND MORGAN
REQUIRE EXPRESS AND MORGAN 


const express = require('express');
const morgan  = require('morgan');
const app = express();

MENTION THE GLOBAL MIDDLEWARES 

CONVERTS INCOMING JOSN DATA TO JS OBJECT FOR FURTHER USE 
app.use(express.json());

ADD THE DEFAULT TOUR ROUTES FOR A PARTICULAR SECTION 

FOR EXAMPLE FOR ALL THE TOUR RELATED ROUTES USE 

app.use('/api/v1/tours', tourRouter); THEN SPECIFY THE OTHER ROUTES. QUERIES ATER THIS ROUTE 


*STEP 4* 
MAKE THE ROUTES FOLDER AN ADD THE REQUIRED ROUTES IN IT 
EXPORT CONTROLLERS BEFORE ADDING ROUTES 

REQUIRE THIS AND START
const express = require('express');
const Router = express.Router();

Router.route('/ROUTENAME')
  .method(name of the controller mentioned in require.controller function to call);



*STEP 5*
NOW BEFORE DEFINING CONTROLLER WE NEED MODELS OF DIFFERENT DATA I.E SCHEMA 

MAKE FOLDER NAMED MODELS 
INSTALL MONGOOSE AND REQUIRE IN THE MODEL FILE 
INSTALL SLUGIFY AND REQUIRE SLUGIFY

*SLUGIFY CONVERTS THE SIGNS AND SYMBOLS TO WORDS IN THE URL FOR EXAMPLE IS A URL HAS $ SLUGIT WILL CONVERT THIS TO DOLLAR*

AND ADD THE REQUIRED SCHEMA OF THE DATA REQUIRED

_THIS FOLDER_ FOLDER CONTAINS THE PRE AND POST FUNCTION THAT WILL ALLOW TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE SCHEMA BEFORE THE QUERY IS BEING EXECUTE

THESE KIND OF ACTS AS THE MIDDLE WARES FOR THE DATA BASE CHANGES BEFORE OR AFTER REQUEST 

BUT THE MIDDLEWARES IN APP.JS ARE THE ONE WHICH CAN BE EXCUTED FOR REQUESTS THAT CAME TO MODIFY THE REQUESTS BUT NOT DATA 

*FILES TILL NOW*
SERVER.JS -- CONTAINS DATA BASE CONNECTION CODE AND PORT TO LISTEN TO APP
APP.JS -- CONTAINS ALL THE MIDDLEWARE USED TO MANIPULATE THE REQUESTS

*FOLDERS*
ROUTES -- CONTAINS THE ROUTES AND CONTROLLER FUNCTION TO BE CALLED 

CONTROLLERS -- CONTANS THE RESPONSE TO CERTAIN REQUESTS

MODELS -- CONTAINS THE MODELLING OF DATA (SCHEMA) AND MIDDLEWARES FOR THE CHANGE IN DATA SET IF REQUIRED USING PRE AND POST FOR SECURITY PURPOSES 

*PACKAGES*
EXPRESS, BODY-PARSER, NODEMON, DOTENV, SLUGIFY, MONGOOSE , VALIDATOR , MORGAN 


*STEP 6*

CREATE THE CONTOLLER FUNCTIIONS WHICH WILL RESPONSD TO THE REQUESTS GIVEN BY THE ROUTES FILE 

_WE CAN CREATE THE FUNCTION IN UTILS FOLDER AND CALL THESE FOLDER IN THE CONTOLLER FILE_

THESE CONTOLLER FUNCTION WILL ALSO HAVE SOME AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
BECAUSE WE CANNOT ADD ALL THE DATA SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO CONVERT SOME DATA THAT IS REUIRED FROM THE EXISTING DATA BEFORE OR AFTER THE QUERY
